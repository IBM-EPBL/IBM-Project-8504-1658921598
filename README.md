### Project description:

Food is essential for human life and has been the concern of many healthcare conventions. Nowadays new dietary assessment and nutrition analysis tools enable more opportunities to help people understand their daily eating habits, exploring nutrition patterns and maintain a healthy diet. Nutritional analysis is the process of determining the nutritional content of food. It is a vital part of analytical chemistry that provides information about the chemical composition, processing, quality control and contamination of food.

The main aim of the project is to building a model which is used for classifying the fruit depends on the different characteristics like colour, shape, texture etc. Here the user can capture the images of different fruits and then the image will be sent the trained model. The model analyses the image and detect the nutrition based on the fruits like (Sugar, Fibre, Protein, Calories, etc.).

### Project flow and progress:

The user interacts with the UI (User Interface) and give the image as input.
Then the input image is then pass to our flask application,
And finally with the help of the model which we build we will classify the result and showcase it on the UI.

To accomplish this, we have to complete all the activities and tasks listed below

Data Collection:

- [x] Collect the dataset or Create the dataset
